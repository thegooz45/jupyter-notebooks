# jupyter-notebooks
a public repo of my jupyter notebook work!

none of the projects are originally mine!!! please keep that into consideration!!!

all of the work you see will be either from my Codecademy course or Udemy course; see it like homework to show what i know. i'll organize it appropriately so it's easy to read~

anyways, thanks for looking! (●´ω｀●)

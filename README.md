# jupyter-notebooks
a public repo of my jupyter notebook work!

none of this is mine unless otherwise stated!!! please keep that into consideration!!!

all of the work you see will be either from my Codecademy course or Udemy. i'll organize it appropriately so it's easy to read~

anyways, thanks for looking! (●´ω｀●)
